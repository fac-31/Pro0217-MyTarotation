It was published on 8 June 1949 by Secker & Warburg as Orwell's ninth and final book completed in his lifetime. Thematically, Nineteen Eighty-Four centres on the consequences of totalitarianism, mass surveillance, and repressive regimentation of persons and behaviours within society. Orwell, himself a democratic socialist, modelled the authoritarian government in the novel after Stalinist Russia. More broadly, the novel examines the role of truth and facts within politics and the ways in which they are manipulated.\r\n\r\n----------\t\t\r\nAlso contained in:\t\t\r\n[Novels (Animal Farm / Burmese Days / Clergyman's Daughter / Coming Up for Air / Keep the Aspidistra Flying / Nineteen Eighty-Four)](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL1168045W)\t\t\r\n[Novels (Animal Farm / Nineteen Eighty-Four)](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL1167981W)\r\n[Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four: Text, Sources, Criticism](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL1168095W)","genres":["futurology","censorship","surveillance","rebels","sting operations","historical negationism","memory holes","thoughtcrime","Outer Party","resistance movements","Newspeak","perpetual war","telescreens","cult of personality","Ingsoc","Satirical literature","English science fiction","FICTION CLASSICS","CLASSICS","CONTEMPORARY FICTION","Man-woman relationships","Politique","Political fiction","Totalitarisme","Fiction","Romans","Facsimiles","Totalitarismo","Husbands","Classic Literature","Manuscripts","Novela política","Middle aged men","Insurance agents","open_syllabus_project","Distopías","Dystopias","Ficción","Ciencia-ficción","Cautionary tales and verse","Dystopias in literature","Suburban life","English fiction","Totalitarianism","Indic fiction (English)","Science Fiction","Traducciones al español","Novela","Novela inglesa","Zukunft","Polizeistaat","English Political fiction","Totalitarianism and literature","History and criticism","Reading Level-Grade 11","Reading Level-Grade 12","British and irish fiction (fictional works by one author)","London (england), fiction","Fiction, political","Fiction, dystopian","Fiction, science fiction, general","English literature","Correspondence","Journalists","English Authors","Correspondence..","Authors and publishers","Fiction, short stories (single author)","British and irish drama (dramatic works by one author)","Brainwashing","Authoritarianism","NOVELAS INGLESAS","Fiction, historical, general","Political science","Satire","Romans, nouvelles","Literature","Fiction, general","Psychological fiction","Drama","Dystopian plays","Essays","Literary","Nationalism","Lexicography","Language & literary studies","English manuscripts","Translations into russian","Translations into urdu","Fantasy","Translations into spanish","Nineteen eighty-four (orwell, george)","Translating and interpreting","Comic books, strips","Adaptations","Totalitarianism--fiction","Pr6029.r8 n49 2003"]},"film":{"title":"The Prestige","plot":"Rival 19th-century magicians engage in a bitter battle for trade secrets.","genres":["Drama,","Mystery,","Sci-Fi"],"art":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA4NDI0MTIxNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNTM0MzY2._V1_SX300.jpg"},"album":{"title":"Random Access Memories","artist":"Daft Punk","genres":["dance","disco","electro","electro-disco","electronic","french house","funk","nu disco","synth funk"],"art":"http://coverartarchive.org/release/5000a285-b67e-4cfc-b54b-2b98f1810d2e/32554171842.jpg"}},{"name":"Madonna","starsign":"aries","mood":"happy","book":{"title":"The Night Circus","art":"https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/8773134-S.jpg","description":"The circus arrives without warning.

Chaque chapitre relate une rencontre du petit prince qui laisse celui-ci perplexe, par rapport aux comportements absurdes des « grandes personnes ». Ces différentes rencontres peuvent être lues comme une allégorie.\r\n\r\nLes aquarelles font partie du texte et participent à cette pureté du langage : dépouillement et profondeur sont les qualités maîtresses de l'œuvre.\r\n\r\nOn peut y lire une invitation de l'auteur à retrouver l'enfant en soi, car « toutes les grandes personnes ont d'abord été des enfants.

No announcements precede it. It is simply there, when yesterday it was not. Within the black-and-white striped canvas tents is an utterly unique experience full of breathtaking amazements. It is called Le Cirque des Rêves, and it is only open at night. But behind the scenes, a fierce competition is underway—a duel between two young magicians, Celia and Marco, who have been trained since childhood expressly for this purpose by their mercurial instructors. Unbeknownst to them, this is a game in which only one can be left standing, and the circus is but the stage for a remarkable battle of imagination and will. Despite themselves, however, Celia and Marco tumble headfirst into love—a deep, magical love that makes the lights flicker and the room grow warm whenever they so much as brush hands. True love or not, the game must play out, and the fates of everyone involved, from the cast of extraordinary circus per formers to the patrons, hang in the balance, suspended as precariously as the daring acrobats overhead. Written in rich, seductive prose, this spell-casting novel is a feast for the senses and the heart. - Publisher.","genres":["New York Times bestseller","Fiction","Magicians","Circus","Games","Circus performers","nyt:hardcover_fiction=2011-12-24","Psychokinesis","Magic","Fate and fatalism","Roman","Night","Amerikanisches Englisch","Competition (Psychology)","Large type books","Fiction, romance, fantasy","Fiction, fantasy, historical","New York Times reviewed"]},"film":{"title":"The Grand Budapest Hotel","plot":"A writer encounters the owner of an aging high-class hotel, who tells him of his early years serving as a lobby boy in the hotel's glorious years under an exceptional concierge.","genres":["Adventure,","Comedy,","Crime"],"art":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzM5NjUxOTEyMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjEyMDM0MDE@._V1_SX300.jpg"},"album":{"title":"Random Access Memories","artist":"Daft Punk","genres":["dance","disco","electro","electro-disco","electronic","french house","funk","nu disco","synth funk"],"art":"http://coverartarchive.org/release/5000a285-b67e-4cfc-b54b-2b98f1810d2e/32554171842.jpg"}},{"name":"David","starsign":"gemini","mood":"happy","book":{"title":"To Kill a Mockingbird","art":"https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/12606502-S.jpg","description":"One of the best-loved stories of all time, To Kill a Mockingbird has been translated into more than 40 languages, sold more than 30 million copies worldwide, served as the basis for an enormously popular motion picture, and voted one of the best novels of the 20th century by librarians across the United States.

No announcements precede it. It is simply there, when yesterday it was not. Within the black-and-white striped canvas tents is an utterly unique experience full of breathtaking amazements. It is called Le Cirque des Rêves, and it is only open at night. But behind the scenes, a fierce competition is underway—a duel between two young magicians, Celia and Marco, who have been trained since childhood expressly for this purpose by their mercurial instructors. Unbeknownst to them, this is a game in which only one can be left standing, and the circus is but the stage for a remarkable battle of imagination and will. Despite themselves, however, Celia and Marco tumble headfirst into love—a deep, magical love that makes the lights flicker and the room grow warm whenever they so much as brush hands. True love or not, the game must play out, and the fates of everyone involved, from the cast of extraordinary circus per formers to the patrons, hang in the balance, suspended as precariously as the daring acrobats overhead. Written in rich, seductive prose, this spell-casting novel is a feast for the senses and the heart. - Publisher.","genres":["New York Times bestseller","Fiction","Magicians","Circus","Games","Circus performers","nyt:hardcover_fiction=2011-12-24","Psychokinesis","Magic","Fate and fatalism","Roman","Night","Amerikanisches Englisch","Competition (Psychology)","Large type books","Fiction, romance, fantasy","Fiction, fantasy, historical","New York Times reviewed"]},"film":{"title":"Guardians of the Galaxy","plot":"A group of intergalactic criminals must pull together to stop a fanatical warrior with plans to purge the universe.","genres":["Action,","Adventure,","Comedy"],"art":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2ZmNjQ2MzAtNDlhNi00MmQyLWJhZDMtNmJiMjFlOWY4MzcxXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX300.jpg"},"album":{"title":"Random Access Memories","artist":"Daft Punk","genres":["dance","disco","electro","electro-disco","electronic","french house","funk","nu disco","synth funk"],"art":"http://coverartarchive.org/release/5000a285-b67e-4cfc-b54b-2b98f1810d2e/32554171842.jpg"}},{"name":"Anna","starsign":"aries","mood":"sad","book":{"title":"ノルウェイの森","art":"https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/2237620-S.jpg","description":"Mientras su avión aterriza en un aeropuerto europeo, Toru Watanabe, de treinta y siete años, escucha casualmente una vieja canción de los Beatles: de pronto, la música le hace retroceder a su juventud, al turbulento Tokio de finales de los sesenta. Recuerda entonces, con melancolía y desasosiego, a la inestable y misteriosa Naoko, la novia de su mejor -y único- amigo de la adolescencia, Kizuki, y cómo el suicidio de éste les distanció durante un año, hasta que se reencontraron en la universidad.

Al poco, Watanabe se enamoró de Midori, una joven activa y resuelta. Indeciso, acosado por los temores, Watanabe sólo experimentaba el deslumbramiento y el desengaño allá donde todo debía cobrar sentido: el sexo, el amor y la muerte.

Chaque chapitre relate une rencontre du petit prince qui laisse celui-ci perplexe, par rapport aux comportements absurdes des « grandes personnes ». Ces différentes rencontres peuvent être lues comme une allégorie.\r\n\r\nLes aquarelles font partie du texte et participent à cette pureté du langage : dépouillement et profondeur sont les qualités maîtresses de l'œuvre.\r\n\r\nOn peut y lire une invitation de l'auteur à retrouver l'enfant en soi, car « toutes les grandes personnes ont d'abord été des enfants.

It was published on 8 June 1949 by Secker & Warburg as Orwell's ninth and final book completed in his lifetime. Thematically, Nineteen Eighty-Four centres on the consequences of totalitarianism, mass surveillance, and repressive regimentation of persons and behaviours within society. Orwell, himself a democratic socialist, modelled the authoritarian government in the novel after Stalinist Russia. More broadly, the novel examines the role of truth and facts within politics and the ways in which they are manipulated.\r\n\r\n----------\t\t\r\nAlso contained in:\t\t\r\n[Novels (Animal Farm / Burmese Days / Clergyman's Daughter / Coming Up for Air / Keep the Aspidistra Flying / Nineteen Eighty-Four)](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL1168045W)\t\t\r\n[Novels (Animal Farm / Nineteen Eighty-Four)](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL1167981W)\r\n[Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four: Text, Sources, Criticism](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL1168095W)","genres":["futurology","censorship","surveillance","rebels","sting operations","historical negationism","memory holes","thoughtcrime","Outer Party","resistance movements","Newspeak","perpetual war","telescreens","cult of personality","Ingsoc","Satirical literature","English science fiction","FICTION CLASSICS","CLASSICS","CONTEMPORARY FICTION","Man-woman relationships","Politique","Political fiction","Totalitarisme","Fiction","Romans","Facsimiles","Totalitarismo","Husbands","Classic Literature","Manuscripts","Novela política","Middle aged men","Insurance agents","open_syllabus_project","Distopías","Dystopias","Ficción","Ciencia-ficción","Cautionary tales and verse","Dystopias in literature","Suburban life","English fiction","Totalitarianism","Indic fiction (English)","Science Fiction","Traducciones al español","Novela","Novela inglesa","Zukunft","Polizeistaat","English Political fiction","Totalitarianism and literature","History and criticism","Reading Level-Grade 11","Reading Level-Grade 12","British and irish fiction (fictional works by one author)","London (england), fiction","Fiction, political","Fiction, dystopian","Fiction, science fiction, general","English literature","Correspondence","Journalists","English Authors","Correspondence..","Authors and publishers","Fiction, short stories (single author)","British and irish drama (dramatic works by one author)","Brainwashing","Authoritarianism","NOVELAS INGLESAS","Fiction, historical, general","Political science","Satire","Romans, nouvelles","Literature","Fiction, general","Psychological fiction","Drama","Dystopian plays","Essays","Literary","Nationalism","Lexicography","Language & literary studies","English manuscripts","Translations into russian","Translations into urdu","Fantasy","Translations into spanish","Nineteen eighty-four (orwell, george)","Translating and interpreting","Comic books, strips","Adaptations","Totalitarianism--fiction","Pr6029.r8 n49 2003"]},"film":{"title":"The Matrix","plot":"When a beautiful stranger leads computer hacker Neo to a forbidding underworld, he discovers the shocking truth--the life he knows is the elaborate deception of an evil cyber-intelligence.","genres":["Action,","Sci-Fi"],"art":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2NmN2VhMTQtMDNiOS00NDlhLTliMjgtODE2ZTY0ODQyNDRhXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX300.jpg"},"album":{"title":"Random Access Memories","artist":"Daft Punk","genres":["dance","disco","electro","electro-disco","electronic","french house","funk","nu disco","synth funk"],"art":"http://coverartarchive.org/release/5000a285-b67e-4cfc-b54b-2b98f1810d2e/32554171842.jpg"}},{"name":"David","starsign":"pisces","mood":"happy","film":{"title":"Guardians of the Galaxy","plot":"A group of intergalactic criminals must pull together to stop a fanatical warrior with plans to purge the universe.","genres":["Action,","Adventure,","Comedy"],"art":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2ZmNjQ2MzAtNDlhNi00MmQyLWJhZDMtNmJiMjFlOWY4MzcxXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX300.jpg"},"album":{"title":"Michael Jackson’s This Is It","artist":"Michael Jackson","genres":["contemporary r&b","dance-pop","new jack swing","pop","r&b","rock","soul"],"art":"http://coverartarchive.org/release/09ab0aee-a7b2-4e95-8981-0476eaacc7d9/17417490515.jpg"}},{"name":"David","starsign":"pisces","mood":"happy","book":{"title":"The Night Circus","art":"https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/8773134-S.jpg","description":"The circus arrives without warning.

A gripping, heart-wrenching, and wholly remarkable tale of coming-of-age in a South poisoned by virulent prejudice, it views a world of great beauty and savage inequities through the eyes of a young girl, as her father -- a crusading local lawyer -- risks everything to defend a black man unjustly accused of a terrible crime.\r\n\r\nLawyer Atticus Finch defends Tom Robinson -- a black man charged with the rape of a white girl. Writing through the young eyes of Finch's children Scout and Jem, Harper Lee explores with rich humor and unswerving honesty the irrationality of adult attitudes toward race and class in small-town Alabama during the mid-1930s Depression years. The conscience of a town steeped in prejudice, violence, and hypocrisy is pricked by the stamina and quiet heroism of one man's struggle for justice.

A gripping, heart-wrenching, and wholly remarkable tale of coming-of-age in a South poisoned by virulent prejudice, it views a world of great beauty and savage inequities through the eyes of a young girl, as her father -- a crusading local lawyer -- risks everything to defend a black man unjustly accused of a terrible crime.\r\n\r\nLawyer Atticus Finch defends Tom Robinson -- a black man charged with the rape of a white girl.

No announcements precede it. It is simply there, when yesterday it was not. Within the black-and-white striped canvas tents is an utterly unique experience full of breathtaking amazements. It is called Le Cirque des Rêves, and it is only open at night. But behind the scenes, a fierce competition is underway—a duel between two young magicians, Celia and Marco, who have been trained since childhood expressly for this purpose by their mercurial instructors. Unbeknownst to them, this is a game in which only one can be left standing, and the circus is but the stage for a remarkable battle of imagination and will. Despite themselves, however, Celia and Marco tumble headfirst into love—a deep, magical love that makes the lights flicker and the room grow warm whenever they so much as brush hands. True love or not, the game must play out, and the fates of everyone involved, from the cast of extraordinary circus per formers to the patrons, hang in the balance, suspended as precariously as the daring acrobats overhead. Written in rich, seductive prose, this spell-casting novel is a feast for the senses and the heart. - Publisher.","genres":["New York Times bestseller","Fiction","Magicians","Circus","Games","Circus performers","nyt:hardcover_fiction=2011-12-24","Psychokinesis","Magic","Fate and fatalism","Roman","Night","Amerikanisches Englisch","Competition (Psychology)","Large type books","Fiction, romance, fantasy","Fiction, fantasy, historical","New York Times reviewed"]},"film":{"title":"Back to the Future","plot":"Marty McFly, a 17-year-old high school student, is accidentally sent 30 years into the past in a time-traveling DeLorean invented by his close friend, the maverick scientist Doc Brown.","genres":["Adventure,","Comedy,","Sci-Fi"],"art":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmM3ZjE0NzctNjBiOC00MDZmLTgzMTUtNGVlOWFlOTNiZDJiXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX300.jpg"},"album":{"title":"Taylor Swift Karaoke: 1989","artist":"Taylor Swift","genres":["instrumental","pop"],"art":"http://coverartarchive.org/release/68f3a234-aa98-442d-bd1a-144d762fe4f3/30291100538.jpg"}},{"name":"David","starsign":"aries","mood":"happy","book":{"title":"The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy","art":"https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/12986869-S.jpg","description":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is the first of six books in the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy comedy science fiction \"hexalogy\" by Douglas Adams.

Thus, it is imperative that at least one of the girls marry well to support the others, which is a motivation that drives the plot.","genres":["Fiction, Romance, Historical, Regency","British and irish fiction (fictional works by one author)","Brothers and sisters","Courtship","Drama","English fiction","English literature","Families","Family","Family life","Family relations","Fiction Classics","History","Interpersonal relations","Juvenile fiction","Literary Fiction","love stories","manners","Manners and customs","marriage","Sisters","Social classes","Social life and customs","Upper class","wealth","Women in England","young ladies","Young women","entail","Young women, fiction","Sisters, fiction","Fiction, family life, general","England, fiction","Man-woman relationships, fiction","Roman anglais","Classes sociales","Romans, nouvelles","Sœurs","Amours","Jeunes femmes","Familles","Mœurs et coutumes\"","Clases sociales","Novela","Jóvenes (Mujeres)","Cortejo amoroso","Hermanas","Cuentos de amor","Fiction, coming of age","Fiction, romance, general","Great britain, social life and customs, fiction","Readers","Prejudices","Romance fiction","Historical fiction","Classical literature","Domestic fiction","English language, textbooks for foreign speakers","Women, fiction","Adaptations","Gentry","Mate selection","Fiction, romance, historical, general","English literature (collections)","Coloring books","Fiction, family life","Language and languages, study and teaching","Emoticons","Drama (dramatic works by one author)","Feelings","Class","Englisch","Roman","Sociala klasser i litteraturen","Prophecies","Great britain","Reading level-grade 7","Reading level-grade 9","Reading level-grade 8","Reading level-grade 11","Reading level-grade 10","Reading level-grade 12","Large type books","Fiction, romance, historical","Austen, jane, 1775-1817","Literature and fiction (general)","English literature, history and criticism","England","Художественная литература -- Великобритания -- Английская литература -- 1-ая пол. 19 в. -- Романы","Novel","Fiction"]},"film":{"title":"Guardians of the Galaxy","plot":"A group of intergalactic criminals must pull together to stop a fanatical warrior with plans to purge the universe.","genres":["Action,","Adventure,","Comedy"],"art":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2ZmNjQ2MzAtNDlhNi00MmQyLWJhZDMtNmJiMjFlOWY4MzcxXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX300.jpg"},"album":{"title":"Random Access Memories","artist":"Daft Punk","genres":["dance","disco","electro","electro-disco","electronic","french house","funk","nu disco","synth funk"],"art":"http://coverartarchive.org/release/5000a285-b67e-4cfc-b54b-2b98f1810d2e/32554171842.jpg"}},{"name":"David","starsign":"aries","mood":"happy","book":{"title":"The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy","art":"https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/12986869-S.jpg","description":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is the first of six books in the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy comedy science fiction \"hexalogy\" by Douglas Adams.

A gripping, heart-wrenching, and wholly remarkable tale of coming-of-age in a South poisoned by virulent prejudice, it views a world of great beauty and savage inequities through the eyes of a young girl, as her father -- a crusading local lawyer -- risks everything to defend a black man unjustly accused of a terrible crime.\r\n\r\nLawyer Atticus Finch defends Tom Robinson -- a black man charged with the rape of a white girl. Writing through the young eyes of Finch's children Scout and Jem, Harper Lee explores with rich humor and unswerving honesty the irrationality of adult attitudes toward race and class in small-town Alabama during the mid-1930s Depression years. The conscience of a town steeped in prejudice, violence, and hypocrisy is pricked by the stamina and quiet heroism of one man's struggle for justice. But the weight of history will only tolerate so much.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\nAlso contained in:\r\n\r\n - [Best Sellers from Reader's Digest Condensed Books](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL16035425W)","genres":["fiction","fiction classics","contemporary fiction","racial segregation","mob mentality","Southern Gothic","southern life","racial injustice","class","courage","compassion","gender roles","laws","loss of innocence","rape trials","domestic fiction","legal stories","Bildungsromans","Race relations","Lawyers","Girls","Prejudices","Fathers and daughters","Trials (Rape)","Great Depression","African Americans","Father-daughter relationship,","Toleranz","Kind","American fiction (fictional works by one author)","Fiction, coming of age","Fiction, family life","Fiction, legal","Fathers and daughters, fiction","Southern states, fiction","Lawyers, fiction","African americans, fiction","Social life and customs","Manners and customs","Padres e hijas","Novela","Relaciones raciales","Procesos por violación","Spanish language materials","Father-daughter relationship","New York Times reviewed","American literature","Fiction, family life, general","Large type books","Muchachas","Ficción","Relations raciales","Romans, nouvelles","Procès (Viol)","Filles","Classics","Literary","American fiction","Estados del Sur (Estados Unidos)","Juvenile fiction","Families","Fiction, general"]},"film":{"title":"Back to the Future","plot":"Marty McFly, a 17-year-old high school student, is accidentally sent 30 years into the past in a time-traveling DeLorean invented by his close friend, the maverick scientist Doc Brown.","genres":["Adventure,","Comedy,","Sci-Fi"],"art":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmM3ZjE0NzctNjBiOC00MDZmLTgzMTUtNGVlOWFlOTNiZDJiXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX300.jpg"},"album":{"title":"1984","artist":"Van Halen","genres":["aor","arena rock","hard rock","heavy metal","pop","pop rock","rock"],"art":"http://coverartarchive.org/release/ff565cd7-acf8-4dc0-9603-72d1b7ae284b/2570021325.jpg"}},{"name":"David","starsign":"aries","mood":"happy","book":{"title":"Ready Player One","art":"https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/8737626-S.jpg","description":"In the year 2044. reality is an ugly place.

But behind the scenes, a fierce competition is underway—a duel between two young magicians, Celia and Marco, who have been trained since childhood expressly for this purpose by their mercurial instructors. Unbeknownst to them, this is a game in which only one can be left standing, and the circus is but the stage for a remarkable battle of imagination and will. Despite themselves, however, Celia and Marco tumble headfirst into love—a deep, magical love that makes the lights flicker and the room grow warm whenever they so much as brush hands. True love or not, the game must play out, and the fates of everyone involved, from the cast of extraordinary circus per formers to the patrons, hang in the balance, suspended as precariously as the daring acrobats overhead.

She also is strangely beguiling, fiery, and intelligent. And while Don quickly disqualifies her as a candidate for the Wife Project, as a DNA expert Don is particularly suited to help Rosie on her own quest: identifying her biological father. When an unlikely relationship develops as they collaborate on the Father Project, Don is forced to confront the spontaneous whirlwind that is Rosie—and the realization that, despite your best scientific efforts, you don’t find love, it finds you. \r\n\r\nArrestingly endearing and entirely unconventional, Graeme Simsion’s distinctive debut will resonate with anyone who has ever tenaciously gone after life or love in the face of great challenges. The Rosie Project is a rare find: a book that restores our optimism in the power of human connection.","genres":["Australia","genetics","research","romance","marriage","college teachers","Fiction","Interpersonal relations","Romance fiction","Australian fiction","Large type books","nyt:trade-fiction-paperback=2014-06-22","New York Times bestseller","New York Times reviewed","College teachers, fiction","Marriage, fiction","Australia, fiction","Fiction, romance, contemporary","Love stories","Asperger-Syndrom","Partnerwahl","Littérature australienne","Roman","Relations amoureuses","Généticiens","Romans, nouvelles","Génétique","Choix du conjoint","Pères naturels","Identification","Questionnaires","Maestros universitarios","Novela","Genética","Investigaciones","Matrimonio","College teachers -- Australia -- Fiction","Genetics -- Research -- Fiction","Marriage -- Fiction","Mariage -- Romans, nouvelles, etc","Genetics -- Research"]},"film":{"title":"Guardians of the Galaxy","plot":"A group of intergalactic criminals must pull together to stop a fanatical warrior with plans to purge the universe.","genres":["Action,","Adventure,","Comedy"],"art":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2ZmNjQ2MzAtNDlhNi00MmQyLWJhZDMtNmJiMjFlOWY4MzcxXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX300.jpg"},"album":{"title":"Future Nostalgia","artist":"Dua Lipa","genres":["dance-pop","electronic","electropop","funktronica","nu disco","pop","power pop","synth-pop"],"art":"http://coverartarchive.org/release/315bbc48-dea9-463c-bfa9-a6ccab78b990/25806517352.jpg"}},{"name":"David","starsign":"aries","mood":"happy","book":{"title":"Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine","art":"https://via.placeholder.com/100x150?text=No+Cover","description":"No description available.","genres":["Unknown Genre"]},"film":{"title":"Guardians of the Galaxy","plot":"A group of intergalactic criminals must pull together to stop a fanatical warrior with plans to purge the universe.","genres":["Action,","Adventure,","Comedy"],"art":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2ZmNjQ2MzAtNDlhNi00MmQyLWJhZDMtNmJiMjFlOWY4MzcxXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX300.jpg"},"album":{"title":"Future Nostalgia","artist":"Dua Lipa","genres":["dance-pop","electronic","electropop","funktronica","nu disco","pop","power pop","synth-pop"],"art":"http://coverartarchive.org/release/315bbc48-dea9-463c-bfa9-a6ccab78b990/25806517352.jpg"}}]}
