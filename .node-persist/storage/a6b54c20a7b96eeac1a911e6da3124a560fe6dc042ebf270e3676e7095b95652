Nazi Germany. The country is holding its breath. Death has never been busier, and will become busier still.\r\n\r\nLiesel Meminger is a foster girl living outside of Munich, who scratches out a meager existence for herself by stealing when she encounters something she can’t resist–books. With the help of her accordion-playing foster father, she learns to read and shares her stolen books with her neighbors during bombing raids as well as with the Jewish man hidden in her basement. \r\n\r\nIn superbly crafted writing that burns with intensity, award-winning author Markus Zusak, author of I Am the Messenger, has given us one of the most enduring stories of our time.\r\n \r\n“The kind of book that can be life-changing.” —The New York Times","genres":["nyt:young-adult-paperback-monthly=2022-09-04","New York Times bestseller","New York Times reviewed","Books and reading","Fiction","Jews","History","World War, 1939-1945","Rescue","Storytelling","Death","Novela australiana","Livres et lecture","Romans, nouvelles","Juifs","Histoire","Guerre mondiale, 1939-1945","Sauvetage","Libros y lectura","Novela","Judios","Historia","Guerra Mundial II, 1939-1945","Book thefts","Jews rescue (1939-1945 : World War) fast (OCoLC)fst01710189","World War (1939-1945) fast (OCoLC)fst01180924","Death, fiction","Germany, history, fiction","Jews, history, fiction","World war, 1939-1945, fiction","Children's fiction","Storytelling, fiction","Books and reading, fiction","Juvenile fiction","Art de conter","Mort","World war ii","Gestapo","Judaism","Nazi","Nazi germany","Historical fiction","Narración de cuentos","Muerte","Literature","Judíos","Nyt:paperback_books=2007-09-09","Ficción","Jews rescue","German history","Books","Reading","Spanish language materials","Ficción juvenil","Guerra mundial ii","Fictional works","Large type books","Memory","Mothers","Family problems","Young adult fiction","Death (personification)","Germany"]}],"movies":[{"title":"The Green Mile","plot":"Paul Edgecomb, the head guard of a prison, meets an inmate, John Coffey, a black man who is accused of murdering two girls.
